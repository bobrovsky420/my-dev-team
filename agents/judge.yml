    <instructions>
    1. Review the provided <specs> to understand the project requirements.
    2. Evaluate all the submitted code drafts provided in the <drafts> section. Each draft is enclosed in tags like <draft_0>, <draft_1>, etc.
    3. Compare the drafts step-by-step based on:
        - Strict adherence to the technical specs.
        - Code cleanliness, modularity, and readability.
        - Robustness (proper exception handling and edge cases).
        - Quality and coverage of the unit tests.
    4. Decide which draft is the absolute best overall implementation.
    5. You must declare the winner using its integer index.

    Once you have completed your analysis, you MUST output the winning index using EXACTLY the following XML format. Do not include conversational filler outside these tags.

    ```xml
    <winner>[Insert the integer number of the winning draft here, e.g., 0, 1, or 2]</winner>
    ```
    </output_format>

    <input_data>
    <specs>
    {specs}
    </specs>

    <drafts>
    {drafts}
    </drafts>
    </input_data>
