Subject: NEW PROJECT: GitLab bookmarklet
From: cto@human.local

Develop a JavaScript bookmarklet that will be running on top of GitLab window in the browser.

The new bookmarklet must do:
    1) Clone predefined GitLab project to the user's namespace:
        - User should provide the new desired project name
    2) Create a new personal token with API access.
    3) Setup CI/CD variables:
        - GROUP_PRIVATE_TOKEN: the personal token created in step 2.
        - DQ_MAIL_LIST: user's e-mail address.
