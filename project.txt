Subject: NEW PROJECT: GitLab scrum quality auditor (GSQA Bot)
From: cto@human.local
To: manager@ai-crew.local

Develop a Python-based auditing tool to enforce data integrity and Scrum best practices for GitLab artifacts within a specific group.
The application will act as an automated "Scrum Master Assistant" to ensure project tracking is accurate and complete.
The application must handle epics and issues that span multiple projects within the same group.

Core Functional Requirements
============================

Data Acquisition: Use the GitLab API (or specialised library) to fetch all open epics and issues from a specified GitLab group.

Validation Engine: Process the fetched data against the following integrity rules:

RULE1: Every issue must be linked to a parent epic.
RULE2: Every epic must have both a start date and a due date defined.
RULE3: An issue's due date must not exceed the due date of its parent epic.
RULE4: If an issue is assigned to an iteration, it must have at least one assignee.

Reporting: Generate a summary report (console and markdown) listing all artifacts that violate these rules, categorized by severity.
